# Compiler-Construction-CPP-LEX-Tool
This project involves creating a C++ program to mimic the LEX tool. It parses an input string into the longest lexemes using given regular expressions from 'input.txt'. The output is written to 'output.txt' as '&lt;lexeme,index>' pairs, indicating the longest prefixes matching the regular expressions.
